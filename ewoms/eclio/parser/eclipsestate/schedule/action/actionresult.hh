/*
  The Action::Result class is used to hold the boolean result of a ACTIONX
  condition like:

        WWCT > 0.75

   and also the final evaluation of an ACTIONX condition comes as a
   Action::Result instance.

   In addition to the overall truthness of the expression an Action::Result
   instance can optionally have a set of matching wells. For instance the
   the result of:

        FWCT > 0.75

   Will not contain any wells, whereas the result of:

        WWCT > 0.75

   will contain a set of all the wells matching the condition. The set of
   matching wells can be queries with the wells() method. When a result with
   wells and a result without wells are combined as:

        WWCT > 0.50 AND FPR > 1000

   The result will have all the wells corresponding to the first condition, when
   several results with wells are combined with logical operators AND and OR the
   set of matching wells are combined correspondingly. It is actually possible
   to have a result which evaluates to true and still have and zero matching
   wells - e.g.

       WWCT > 1.25 OR FOPT > 1

   If the condition evaluates to true the set of matching wells will be passed
   to the Schedule::applyAction() method, and will be used in place of '?' in
   keywords like WELOPEN.
