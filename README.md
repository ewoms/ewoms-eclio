The ewoms-eclio module
=========================

This eWoms module implements the functionality that is needed to read
and write files that are compatible with the ECLIPSE100 and ECLIPSE300
reservoir simulators.

Installation
============

Like all eWoms modules, ewoms-eclio uses the DUNE build system to
handle the building and installation process. It is thus supposed to
be build using the `dunecontrol` utility. Please confer to the [INSTALL](https://github.com/ewoms/ewoms-common/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file located in the ewoms-common module for detailed build
instructions.
